# Zimbra-to-QuickBooks Billing Automation

**Version**: v1.13.0

**Status**: ‚úÖ Production-ready, tested with QuickBooks Sandbox and used in production at Mission Critical Email

Welcome! This is an automated monthly billing system for Zimbra BSPs (Bulk Service Providers) using QuickBooks Online.

## What This Does

Automates the entire monthly billing process:

1. **Fetches** weekly usage reports from your Zimbra server (via SSH)
2. **Calculates** monthly high-water marks per domain and Class of Service
3. **Maps** domains to QuickBooks customers automatically
4. **Creates** draft invoices in QuickBooks Online
5. **Generates** Excel reports for your records

All you need to do is review and send the invoices from QuickBooks!

## Our Approach: Class of Service Based Pricing

We bill based on **Classes of Service** (CoS) - each Zimbra CoS (e.g., "2GB Mailbox", "50GB Mailbox") maps to a QuickBooks service item with its own price. The system calculates the maximum mailboxes per domain/CoS during the month (high-water mark) and bills accordingly.

## System Requirements

- **Billing Application**: Python 3.8+ (runs on macOS, Linux, or Windows)
- **Zimbra Server**: Linux (for usage report generation)
- **QuickBooks**: QuickBooks Online account
