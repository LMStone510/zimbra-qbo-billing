## 1. Architecture & Design

### 1.1 Overall Architecture
**Rating: 9/10**

The application follows a well-structured modular architecture:

```
src/
├── database/       # SQLAlchemy models and queries
├── zimbra/         # Zimbra integration (SSH/parsing)
├── qbo/           # QuickBooks Online integration
├── reconciliation/ # Domain/customer mapping logic
├── reporting/      # Excel report generation
├── ui/            # CLI interface
└── main.py        # Orchestration layer
```

**Strengths:**
- Clear separation of concerns with dedicated modules
- Database-driven state management using SQLAlchemy
- Clean abstraction layers between external services
- Consistent error handling patterns across modules

**Recommendations:**
- Consider implementing a service layer pattern for complex business logic
- Add dependency injection for better testability
- Consider async/await for I/O operations to improve performance

### 1.2 Design Patterns
**Rating: 8/10**

The codebase effectively uses several design patterns:
- **Repository Pattern**: Database queries abstracted through QueryHelper
- **Factory Pattern**: Configuration management
- **Context Managers**: SSH connections and database sessions
- **Decorator Pattern**: Retry logic with exponential backoff

---

## 2. Code Quality

### 2.1 Code Readability
**Rating: 9/10**

**Strengths:**
- Consistent naming conventions (PEP 8 compliant)
- Comprehensive docstrings for all major functions
- Clear variable names that express intent
- Well-organized imports

**Example of Good Practice:**
```python
def calculate_monthly_highwater(self, parsed_reports: List[Dict]) -> Dict[Tuple[str, str], Dict]:
    """Calculate the monthly high-water mark for each domain/CoS combination.
    
    Args:
        parsed_reports: List of parsed report dictionaries
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping (domain, cos_name) -> {'count': max_count, 'peak_date': date}
    """
```

### 2.2 Code Maintainability
**Rating: 8/10**

**Strengths:**
- Modular design allows for easy updates
- Configuration externalized to .env and JSON files
- Comprehensive logging throughout
- Version tracking in setup.py

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Some functions exceed 50 lines (should be refactored)
- Magic numbers should be extracted to constants
- Consider using dataclasses for complex data structures

### 2.3 Error Handling
**Rating: 9/10**

Excellent error handling implementation:
- Custom exception hierarchy for QBO errors
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Comprehensive error logging with appropriate levels

---

## 3. Security Analysis

### 3.1 Authentication & Authorization
**Rating: 9/10**

**Strengths:**
- OAuth 2.0 implementation for QuickBooks
- Encrypted token storage using Fernet (cryptography library)
- Secure SSH key-based authentication for Zimbra
- Token refresh mechanism to maintain sessions

**Security Measures:**
```python
# Encrypted token storage
cipher = Fernet(self._encryption_key)
encrypted = cipher.encrypt(token_json.encode())
self.token_file.chmod(0o600)  # Restrictive file permissions
```

### 3.2 Input Validation
**Rating: 8/10**

**Strengths:**
- Query string escaping for QBO API calls
- Path traversal prevention in SSH operations
- Input sanitization for user-provided data

**Recommendations:**
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- Implement input validation schemas (e.g., using Pydantic)
- Add SQL injection prevention for raw queries

### 3.3 Sensitive Data Handling
**Rating: 8/10**

**Good Practices:**
- Credentials stored in .env file (excluded from version control)
- Token masking in logs
- No hardcoded credentials in source code

**Concerns:**
- Consider using a secrets management service for production
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations

---

## 4. Performance Considerations
